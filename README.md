This smart contract is designed to manage a list of Teacher in a university. It allows for the addition of teacher, updating their departments, deactivating teacher, and retrieving teacher details.
The contract ensures data integrity and proper function execution using Solidity's error-handling mechanisms (require(), assert(), and revert()).

- Public variables to store token details such as name, abbreviation, and total supply.
- A mapping to track balances of different addresses.
- This project promotes transparency and trust in University operations by securely managing teacher information on the blockchain.
